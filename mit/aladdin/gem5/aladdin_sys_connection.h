 *
 *   ioctl(ALADDIN_FD, REQUEST_CODE, finish_flag);
 *
 * ALADDIN_FD is a special file descriptor reserved for Aladdin.
 * The request code specifies which accelerator to activate. This requires
 * agreement with the accelerator_id parameter used in the Python scripts to
 * bring up the system.
 * The finish flag is a shared memory address that the accelerator will write to
 * when it is finished. This will signal to the core that the accelerator is
 * finished.
